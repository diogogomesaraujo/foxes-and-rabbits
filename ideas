use blocked approach for parallel with divide and conquer !!
each block has abstraction of ----> 1 block beyond border that is to be used to sync after

strategy divide and conquer
--> divide by P then by P then by P .... until reached min blocksize ---> where sequential wins
spawn P virtual within each block being the matrix the initial block

sync recursively in the end
sync should combine the edges of each block (o quadriculado) which should not cause any dependency problems (due to simple move and concurrency clause)

blocks may have variable size depending on number of processes ---> priorize horizontalwise so there is more cache locality

each thread gets 1 block ---> virtual threads
